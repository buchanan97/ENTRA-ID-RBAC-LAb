# HomeLab RBAC Onboarding Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) onboarding process for the HomeLab environment. The purpose of implementing RBAC is to manage user permissions and access to resources effectively, ensuring that users can only interact with the areas and data relevant to their roles.

## Objectives
- To define user roles and permissions clearly.
- To streamline the onboarding process for new users.
- To enhance security by limiting access based on roles.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Roles**: Identify different roles within the HomeLab and their respective access needs.
2. **Assign Permissions**: Map permissions to each role, ensuring that each role has the minimum necessary access.
3. **User Onboarding**: Develop a structured onboarding process that assigns roles to new users based on their job requirements.
4. **Review and Audit**: Establish regular reviews of user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate over time.

## Conclusion
Implementing RBAC in the HomeLab will enhance the security and efficiency of our operations by ensuring that access to sensitive data and functions is appropriately managed.
